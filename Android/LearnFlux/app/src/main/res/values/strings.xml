        LASALLE College of the Arts provides a supportive, progressive and truly inspiring
        environment for our students.
        \nWith a focus on nurturing creative expression, innovation and independence of thought,
        we encourage students to be inquisitive and original artists and designers.
        They become highly skilled, and excel both in their chosen specialisms and in their
        collaborations
        with practitioners from other disciplines.
        \nThe College prepares graduates for sustained and successful careers in the creative
        industries through
        a practice-based and industry-led pedagogy. It is a demanding and immersive learning
        experience guided
        by an outstanding international faculty, professional artists, and industry mentors.
        We foster high-level creative skills, but allow our students to assert their freedom to be
        different,
        and to chart imaginative new territories â€“ and this is what prepares them for real and
        sustainable careers in the arts.
        \nWe offer an exceptional range of Diploma, Bachelors and Masters degree programmes that are
        well respected
        in the global arts arena. With a strategic and central location in Singapore\'s cultural
        district,
        our award-winning, open campus provides a magnificent space and inspirational setting for
        study and creative exchange.
        \nAt LASALLE College of Arts we work continually to innovate in our teaching and research,
        and to set new benchmarks in arts education. We believe in our students and their ability to
        be the pioneers
        who will help to define the future of contemporary arts practice.
